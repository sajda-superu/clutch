## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google Chrome (for Selenium automation)
- ChromeDriver (auto-installed via Homebrew)

### Setup

1. **Clone and navigate:**
   ```bash
   cd clutch_intelligence/
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r config/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install ChromeDriver (macOS):**
   ```bash
   brew install chromedriver
   ```

4. **Initialize directory structure:**
   ```bash
   python config/config.py
   ```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Stage 1: Extract Company URLs from Sitemaps

```bash
# Navigate to stage 1 directory
cd scrapers/stage1_sitemaps/

# Process master sitemap list (40 profile sitemaps)
python bulk_sitemap_processor.py --batch ../../data/processed/clutch_profile_sitemaps_master_list.txt --delay 3

# Results: 10,000+ company profile URLs extracted
# Output: ../../data/exports/sitemap_results/
```

### Stage 2: Extract Detailed Company Profiles

```bash
# Navigate to stage 2 directory  
cd scrapers/stage2_profiles/

# Single profile extraction
python clutch_profile_scraper.py --url "https://clutch.co/profile/100-shapes" --output test_company.json

# Batch processing (first 10 companies)
head -10 ../../data/exports/sitemap_results/extracted_urls_20250604_161856.txt > sample_urls.txt
python clutch_profile_scraper.py --batch-file sample_urls.txt --output batch_results.json --delay 5
```

## 📊 Data Output Examples

### Extracted Company Profile Data
```json
{
  "company_name": "100 Shapes",
  "url": "https://clutch.co/profile/100-shapes",
  "tagline": "Digital Innovators & Problem-Solvers",
  "reviews_count": 0,
  "min_project_size": "$25,000+",
  "hourly_rate": "$100 - $149 / hr",
  "employees": "10 - 49",
  "year_founded": "2011",
  "location": "London, England",
  "services": {
    "UX/UI Design": "40%",
    "Custom Software Development": "20%",
    "Digital Strategy": "20%",
    "Web Development": "20%"
  }
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Scraping Settings
Edit `config/config.py` to customize:

```python
SCRAPING_CONFIG = {
    "default_delay": 3.0,          # Delay between requests
    "conservative_delay": 10.0,     # Conservative delay for large batches
    "max_retries": 3,              # Retry failed requests
    "headless": True,              # Run browser in headless mode
    "request_timeout": 30,         # Request timeout in seconds
}
```

### Output Formats
- **JSON**: Structured data with full field extraction
- **CSV**: Tabular format for spreadsheet analysis
- **TXT**: Simple URL lists for integration

## 🚦 Rate Limiting & Ethics

This system includes comprehensive rate limiting and ethical scraping practices:

- **Configurable delays** between requests (3-10 seconds default)
- **Respect for robots.txt** and site terms of service
- **Error handling** and graceful failure recovery
- **Session management** to avoid overwhelming servers
- **User-agent rotation** for natural request patterns

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Stage 1 Results (Achieved)
- ✅ **40 profile sitemaps** identified from master sitemap
- ✅ **10,000+ company URLs** extracted successfully
- ✅ **100% sitemap processing** success rate
- ✅ **CSV/TXT exports** generated automatically

### Stage 2 Results (Tested)
- ✅ **Cloudflare bypass** working with Selenium
- ✅ **Comprehensive data extraction** from profile pages
- ✅ **JSON structured output** with 15+ data fields
- ✅ **Batch processing** capabilities confirmed
- ✅ **Error recovery** and retry mechanisms active

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**403 Forbidden Errors:**
- Solution: Use Stage 2 scraper with Selenium (bypasses Cloudflare)
- Increase delay between requests
- Verify ChromeDriver installation

**ChromeDriver Issues:**
```bash
# Reinstall ChromeDriver
brew uninstall chromedriver
brew install chromedriver

# Verify installation
chromedriver --version
```

**Missing Dependencies:**
```bash
# Reinstall all packages
pip install --force-reinstall -r config/requirements.txt
```
